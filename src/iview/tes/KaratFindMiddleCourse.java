You're developing a system for scheduling advising meetings with students in a Computer Science program. Each meeting should be scheduled when a student has completed 50% of their academic program.

Each course at our university has at most one prerequisite that must be taken first. No two courses share a prerequisite. There is only one path through the program.

Write a function that takes a list of (prerequisite, course) pairs, and returns the name of the course that the student will be taking when they are halfway through their program. (If a track has an even number of courses, and therefore has two "middle" courses, you should return the first one.)

Sample input 1: (arbitrarily ordered)
prereqs_courses1 = [
	["Foundations of Computer Science", "Operating Systems"],
	["Data Structures", "Algorithms"],
	["Computer Networks", "Computer Architecture"],
	["Algorithms", "Foundations of Computer Science"],
	["Computer Architecture", "Data Structures"],
	["Software Design", "Computer Networks"]
]

In this case, the order of the courses in the program is:
	Software Design
	Computer Networks
	Computer Architecture
	Data Structures
	Algorithms
	Foundations of Computer Science
	Operating Systems

Sample output 1:
	"Data Structures"


Sample input 2:
prereqs_courses2 = [
	["Data Structures", "Algorithms"],
	["Algorithms", "Foundations of Computer Science"],
	["Foundations of Computer Science", "Logic"]
]


Sample output 2:
	"Algorithms"
Sample input 3:
prereqs_courses3 = [
	["Data Structures", "Algorithms"],
]


Sample output 3:
	"Data Structures"
